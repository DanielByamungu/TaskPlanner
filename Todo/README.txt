Throughout the group project, Navneet, Daniel, and Armin worked cohesively to complete our To-Do list. When we first met up, we decided it would be best if we split the work based on the mandatory requirements leaving each of us 3 tasks to complete. This left Navneet with the add function, the display a single task function, and the load accumulated data function.  Daniel was left with the search function, the save function, and the display range function. Lastly, Armin was left with the delete function, the update function, and the display all tasks function. We discussed our problems and sent each other our programs with each other throughout the process on discord and by Wednesday we were able to combine our code for one main running program. The process was fairly simple however Armin had issues with the update function which led to us having a meeting in person on Friday. With our groups collaboration we were able to fix our issue that was caused by using scanf secure instead of scanf. Additionally, we did not allocate the size of the list on the todolist.c file. Once this was completed our code ran smoothly with no issues.
